     * The Shortest Path Algorithm.

        Canton Coders are located around the world. For 2021, we would like to visit every coder IRL. To do this, we must determine the shortest path between each community member's house. 
        Keep in mind, when a community member lives with another community member, it ten times more valuable to visit those community members. 
        The distance between each members is measured in minutes, 
        and the goal is to visit the most community members in 30 calendar days.

        You must write a piece of software that can read from 2 CSVs and will output a route for the most valuable travel route. 
        The input files are as follows:

        members.csv (name,location)
        locations (currentlocation,connectinglocation,timeoftravel)
        The output file should be a list of names in priority order for the most valuable route.
